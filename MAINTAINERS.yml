# Subsystem_Name:
#     status:      One of the following:
#          Maintained: Someone actually looks after it.
#          Odd Fixes: It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do
#            much other than throw the odd patch in. See below..
#          Orphan:  No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the
#            role as you write your new code].
#          Obsolete:  Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means
#            it has been replaced by a better system and you
#            should be using that.
#     description: (can be several lines, only for humans' sake)
#     maintainer:  [GH account name]
#     collaborators:{Tier 2 sub-maintainer} [GH account name]
#     inform:      When a PR is sent to area inform these [can either be a GH account
#                  name, or email/maillist]
#     labels:       GH_labels: (to be auto added to PR)
#     files: 
#     files-regex: Regex of files, matches are part of the subsystem
#     files-exclude:
#     files-regex-exclude: Regex of files, matches will be *excluded* from the
#                  subystem even if they match F patterns
# 
# Flow
# ####
#
# Each new PR, is checked by automatically by a script which does the following:
#
# - users in <maintainers> & <collaborators> are added automatically as reviewers
#   in the GH pull request
# 
# - Labels in <labels> are automatically added to the PR
# 
# - The script which drives ZephyrBot creates a comment with info like below
#   (To create visibility to new contibutors)
#     " This PR affects the following subsystems:
#      Subsystem Name 1:
#        Maintainers: <List of maintainers>
#        Collaborators: <List of sub-maintainers>
#        Status: ...
#        CC: @<list of to GH users be informed>
#     "
# - An e-mail is sent to all e-mail addresses in <inform>
# 
# - Ideally any file in the tree will fall into some category
# 
# 
# Approving modifications to tgis MAINTAINERS.yml file:
# 
# - Changing <maintainers> lines requires TSC approval
# - Changing <Collaborators> lines requires the Maintainer and Collaborators
#   of that subsystem to agree (or vote on it)
# 
# 
# This same script which is used in CI is also be able to parse the file with an
# option to check the validity/integrity of the file, as well as checking to
# which subsystem(s) a set of files belong to, or which a patch is affecting
